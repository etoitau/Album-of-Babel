# The Album of Babel
The Album of Babel contains every possible picture using 24-bit RGB 
color and a 16px by 16 px palette. Draw one to find where it is in 
the album or browse randomly. The url is updated with a permanent 
link to your current position in the album. This project is 
indirectly inspired by the short story The Library of Babel by Borges. 
And more directly by [the webpage of the same name](https://libraryofbabel.info/).
